    KPI VIEWS â€“ GOLD LAYER
    =============================================================================
    This SQL script defines key performance indicator (KPI) views in the gold layer.
    These views are designed to support business intelligence dashboards, performance 
    tracking, and reporting use cases.

    The KPIs focus on four key areas:
    - Student Engagement (e.g., average number of courses per student)
    - Completion Rates (overall and by course)
    - Grade Performance (average scores and pass rates)
    - Revenue Tracking (total and course-level revenue)
