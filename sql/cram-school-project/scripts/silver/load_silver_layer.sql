-- ðŸ§¼ Silver Layer Data Transformation Script
--
-- Description:
-- This script transforms and loads cleaned, standardized, and enriched
-- data from the Bronze layer into the Silver layer of the cram_school database.
--
-- Each INSERT includes operations such as:
-- - Trimming whitespace
-- - Standardizing text formats (e.g., lowercase, title case)
-- - Deriving new columns (e.g., full_name, age, year fields, categories)
-- - Ensuring data consistency for future reporting and ML pipelines
